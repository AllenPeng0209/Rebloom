The AI uses different therapeutic techniques:

**Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT):**
- Identifies thought patterns
- Challenges negative thinking
- Suggests behavioral changes

*Example: "I notice you mentioned feeling like a failure. Can we explore what evidence supports or challenges this thought?"*

**Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT):**
- Teaches emotional regulation
- Provides distress tolerance skills
- Emphasizes mindfulness

*Example: "It sounds like you're experiencing intense emotions right now. Let's try the TIPP technique to help manage this distress."*

- Explores personal values
- Accepts difficult emotions
- Focuses on meaningful action

*Example: "What matters most to you in your relationships? How can we align your actions with these values?"*

### Conversation Best Practices

#### For Best Results:
✅ **Be specific** about your feelings and experiences
✅ **Share context** about your situation
✅ **Express your needs** ("I need comfort" vs "I need practical advice")
✅ **Use the AI's suggestions** and report back on results
✅ **Be patient** - therapeutic progress takes time

#### What to Avoid:
❌ **Don't share sensitive personal information** (SSN, passwords, etc.)
❌ **Don't rely solely on AI** for crisis situations
